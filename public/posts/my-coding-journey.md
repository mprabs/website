# My Coding Journey

So i started coding like 2 years ago... it was hard at first i didnt know what a variable was lol. I remember trying to learn python and i was like "why does indentation matter so much??" its crazy.

But then i found javascript and it was kinda better but also worse?? like `undefined` is not a function... i saw that error so many times i see it in my dreams now.

Anyway i kept learning and built some projects. My first website looked terrible it was just bright red background with blue text haha. But hey we all start somewhere right?

I think the most important thing is to just keep building stuff. dont get stuck in tutorial hell its the worst. just try to make something even if its bad.
