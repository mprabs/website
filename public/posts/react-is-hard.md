# React is Hard

React is so confusing sometimes... hooks are weird why do i need useEffect for everything?? I tried to use `useState` inside a loop once and react yelled at me. apparently thats a "rule of hooks" or whatever.

And dont get me started on redux. so much boilerplate just to change a boolean value. i prefer context api its simpler (i think?).

Also why are there so many ways to style things? css modules, styled components, tailwind... i just want to center a div man.

But yeah react is powerful i guess. once you get it its cool. components are nice. reusability is key.
