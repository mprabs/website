# Day 1 of Blender

## The Beginning

So, I wanted to try out blender because I have always been interested of working on VFX in movies and stuffs. I had a simple generic idea that with blender you can create artificial elements which look nearly exact to the real natural elements or beings. I had also seen a lot of youtube videos in the past of different VFX editors and 3d model artists working on blender.

Now that I bought a Macbook just the day before yesterday, I wanted to test the exact performance of the laptop and also try my curiosity of 3d rendering and blender.

So, there is a video of some guy teaching blender in youtube which I had seen years back. Some days before a youtube channel named Bog also had posted a video of him learning blender and I kind of was inspired to try the challenge myself.

After having lunch, and as it was Saturday, I had free time. So I started myself to start working on it.

## Getting Started

I download blender. Opened youtube on the second screen and started working on it.

From the video, the guy first started out on teaching basic stuffs about blender. Adding shapes, the camera, lighting, moving stuff around, zooming, scrolling etc; tried it myself too. Started to make some notes about what I did (mostly the shortcut keys of what they do) but the creator then gave a link to his docs with all the short key info so I left that eventually.

## The Monkey Project

I went through the tutorial, created a monkey; which is too easy in blender because you can just select a monkey as a shape by default. xD.. Added color in the monkey, a basic hat on the monkeys head and positioned it properly along different axis (X, Y, Z). Then added a color to the monkey. Also learned basic positioning of the element on render view from the camera and finally I had made a monkey with a hat on blender. Noice !

Okay the tutorial 1 just ended and it felt like I had done nothing yet. So onto the next video.

## The Donut Journey Begins

This video was the one that made my donut journey on the board. LOL.

So I first made a shape, a torsiu shape( I think I butchered the name of the shape). The torsiu shape looked like a tyre. So basically a perfect starting shape to make a donut. Learnt about the resolutions of the shape, switching between edit mode and object mode. Then we had to make the faces of the shape distorted to make the torsiu look close to a real world donut as there is no perfect round donut in the world, YET !!

So to do that we had to do select some progression line feature(not sure of the exact name) so it would give a circular area of where the distortion would impact when I change the position of any vertex. Changed some vertices here and there and voila, there was a donut shape.

## Adding the Icing

I thought I just color it and it is ready but no, the video creator wanted some icing on the top of the donut. Okay so to create icing we just duplicate the layer, remove the bottom level vertices of the duplicated one by selecting the one at the bottom and deleting them. There was an interesting thing that while selection it only selected the vertices at the front face so we had to enable X-ray view to see all and then select so it selected all. This one felt important. xD

## The Thunderstorm Interruption

All this while, there was a slight bit of thunder and storm going on outside. The electricity had already gone a couple hours before and the wifi backup was gonna go down all the way. It was so dark outside.

As I was trying to add a snap face feature on the icing to make the icing look like its flowing through the edge of the donut, the youtube video stopped playing. Turns out the wifi backup died and my exiting journey was halted.

## Reflections

Now I know I don't type stuffs. I've reached this far & I'm kind of proud I actually took the time to write this much. Well, thanks to the thunder and storm that took out the electricity. xD But yeah this is my short note of the special blender opening I did today. And now the sun is out, its shining outside. But the electricity is still not back.

So this was my note on my first experience with blender today. Its kind of like how I did everything I did but the last couple of hours. I started this paragraph thinking this would be like a conclusion but I don't know how to end this. But let me try something different.

The END !
xD
